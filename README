========================================================================================
 ++ DESCRIPTION ++
========================================================================================
Runs as daemon and monitors file-changes happened in the directory set in experms.conf.
If changes happened, it adjusts the file-permissions and ownership/group.
You can either define one directory, or several sub-directories with different
ownerships and permissions.
Further it is able to restore all the ownerships and permissions of all files based on
the config-file.


========================================================================================
 ++ USAGE ++
========================================================================================
experms [ start | stop | restart | stat | disable | enable | (log|stdout) | (err|stderr)
| restore | help ]


      Explanation:

            start: Start Experms
             stop: Stop Experms
          restart: Restart Experms
             stat: If Experms is running it displays the PIDs of Experms and
                   Inotifywait
          disable: Prevent Experms from being started
           enable: Allow Experms to be started again
       log|stdout: Display the log-entries in real-time
       err|stderr: Display the error-log-entries in real-time
          restore: Restore the ownership and permissions of all files in the monitored
                   directory
             help: Display a short help

NOTE: YOU NEED TO EDIT THE CONFIGURATION FILE BEFORE RUNNING EXPERMS THE FIRST TIME!


========================================================================================
 ++ RUNNING EXPERMS AS NON-ROOT USER ++
========================================================================================
It's possible to run Experms as non-root user. But there are quiet a few restictions:

 - Only root is able to change the owner of a file.
 - Only the owner of a file or root is able to change the group of a file.
 - Only the owner of a file or root is able to change the permissions of a file.

If you want to run Experms as non-root user, make sure you are the owner of all
monitored files.

NOTE: If a file is modified by another user, it maybe changes it's ownership.
      In this case, Experms would print an error-message if executed as non-root user.

To start Experms as non-root user, you need to make a copy of the config-file
/etc/experms.conf in your home-directory.
This copy can also be .experms.conf in order to hide it.


========================================================================================
 ++ FURTHER CONFIGURATIONS ++
========================================================================================
Experms uses inotifywait to monitor the directories.
Inotifywait allows only a limited number of directories to watch per user.
Per default this is set to 8192.
You can increase this number by writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
You can check the number of directories recursively with:
find /your/directory/ -type d | wc -l


========================================================================================
 ++ FURTHER INFORMATION ++
========================================================================================
As you may know, there's a bug in inotifywait. From the manpages:

"There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code which can cause
events to be missed if they occur in a directory immediately after that directory is
created. This is probably not fixable."

SOLUTION: In experms this is solved as follows: Everytime a directory is changed
Experms will process all the containing files with a delay of 1 second.


========================================================================================
 ++ FILES ++
========================================================================================
For the moment all the related files lie in the directory of the scripts itself.

Exceptions:
/etc/experms.conf
/tmp/perms_pid.sfhsfhi

If executed as root, the scripts as well as the config-file should remain writable
only for root.

List of files:

./experms
./experms.conf
./check-config.sh
./daemon-functions.sh
./experms.1.gz
./COPYING
./README

If Experms was running at least once:

./.experms.err
./.experms.log

While Experms is running:

./.experms.pid
/tmp/perms_pid.sfhsfhi
