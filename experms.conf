##
##  DESCRIPTION: Configuration file for experms.
##
##        NOTES: Experms uses inotifywait to monitor the directories.
##               Inotifywait allows only a limited number of directories to watch per user. Per default this is set to 8192.
##               You can increase this number by writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.
##               You can check the number of directories recursively with:
##               find /your/directory/ -type d | wc -l
##
##               BE VERY CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU ENTER HERE! IT COULD BREAK A LOT! SPECIALLY IF EXPERMS IS EXECUTED WITH ROOT-PERMISSIONS!
##
##               See the README-file for more information.

## Do you want Experms to log it's activities on files in .experms.log? ("yes" or "no")
## log_activities="yes"
log_activities="yes"

## Do you want to monitor only one directory, or are there several sub-directories with different ownership/permissions?
## Monitor several sub-directories? ("yes" or "no")
use_several_dirs=""

## The directory to monitor:
## mondirname="/your/monitored/directory/"
mondirname=""

## Do you want to restore all the ownerships and permissions on every start of Experms?
## In case something has changed since Experms was stopped. ("yes" or "no")
## restore_at_start="no"

##========================================================
## IF WE MONITOR ONLY ONE DIRECTORY, SET FOLLOWING VALUES:
##========================================================

## The owner-name:
## If you don't want to change the owner, just leave it empty.
## onlygrp="owner-name"
onlyown=""

## The group-name:
## If you don't want to change the group, just leave it empty.
## onlygrp="group-name"
onlygrp=""

## The permissions for containing files (octal):
## If you don't want to change the permissions of files, just leave it empty.
## You can use set-UID, set-GID and sticky-bit if you wish to. E.g. "4660".
## onlychmodoktf="660"
onlychmodoktf=""

## The permissions for containing folders (octal):
## If you don't want to change the permissions of folders, just leave it empty.
## You can use set-UID, set-GID and sticky-bit if you wish to. E.g. "4660".

##=============================================================
## IF WE MONITOR SEVERAL SUB-DIRECTORIES, SET FOLLOWING VALUES:
##=============================================================

## The containing sub-directories (comma-separated):
## Only the name itself. If the sub-directory is "/var/media/music/" just enter "music".
## If you want to add a sub-sub-directory, enter "sub-directory/music".
## subdirname="sub-directory1/sub-sub-directory1,sub-directory2,sub-directory3"
subdirname=""

## The owner for the files in the sub-directories (comma-separated):
## NOTE: They necessarily have to be in the same order as in "subdirname" above!!!
## If you don't want to change the owner, just leave it empty.
## Valid examples: "" (nothing) ",,owner1" "owner1,,owner2"
## subdirown="owner1,owner2,owner3"
subdirown=""

## The group for the sub-directories (comma-separated):
## NOTE: They necessarily have to be in the same order as in "subdirname" above!!!
## If you don't want to change the group, just leave it empty.
## Valid examples: "" (nothing) ",group1" "group1,,group2"
